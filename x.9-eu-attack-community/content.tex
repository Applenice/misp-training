\frametitle{What is MISP?}
\begin{itemize}
       \item Open source "TISP" - A TIP with a strong focus on sharing
       \item A tool that {\bf collects} information from partners, your analysts, your tools, feeds
       \item Normalises, correlates, enriches the data
       \item Allows teams and communities to {\bf collaborate}
       \item {\bf Feeds} automated protective tools and analyst tools with the output
       \item A set of tools to manage sharing communities and interconnected MISP servers
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{The growing need to contextualise data}
\begin{itemize}
       \item Contextualisation became more and more important as we as a community matured
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\bf Growth and diversification} of our communities
                \item Distinguish between information of interest and raw data
                \item {\bf False-positive} management
                \item TTPs and aggregate information may be prevalent compared to raw data (risk assessment)
                \item {\bf Increased data volumes} leads to a need to be able to prioritise
	\end{itemize}
	\item These help with filtering your TI based on your {\bf requirements}...
	\item ...as highlighted by a great talk from Pasquale Stirparo titled \textit{Your Requirements Are Not My Requirements}
\end{itemize}

  \frametitle{The emergence of ATT\&CK}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Standardising on high-level {\bf TTPs} was a solution to a long list of issues
    \item Adoption was rapid, tools producing ATT\&CK data, familiar interface for users
    \item A much better take on kill-chain phases in general
    \item Feeds into our {\bf filtering} and {\bf situational awareness}\footnote{ATT\&CK sighting is a standard export format in MISP} needs extremely well
    \item Gave rise to other, ATT\&CK-like systems tackling other concerns
  \end{itemize}

      \item {\bf attck4fraud} \footnote{\url{https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html\#_attck4fraud}} by Francesco Bigarella from ING
      \item {\bf Election guidelines} \footnote{\url{https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html\#_election_guidelines}} by NIS Cooperation Group
      \item {\bf AM!TT Misinformation pattern}  \footnote{\url{https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy/blob/master/clusters/misinfosec-amitt-misinformation-pattern.json}} by the misinfosecproject
      \item Alternative ATT\&CK models still on the rise

        \frametitle{Future of ATT\&CK in MISP Project}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item MISP Galaxy 2.0 will include {\bf improved inter-linking between ATT\&CK and other models} (other galaxy or matrix-like models)
                \item Those relationships will be also shareable within different MISP communities
                \item Improvement into ATT\&CK sub-techniques integration within MISP
        \end{itemize}
