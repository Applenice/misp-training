# MISP Training Materials

This repository includes all the training materials in use such as

- Core MISP (software and standard) trainings
- Threat intelligence and OSINT training
- Building information sharing communities workshop

All the materials are available with the complete LaTeX source code meant to assist in contributing or extending the training materials. A special attention is given to the open source licensing
given to the materials. We welcome contributions in order to improve the training set for threat intelligence, intelligence gathering and analysis along with specific aspects of information sharing/exchange in information and national security.
